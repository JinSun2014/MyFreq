Dear Mr. Mendes,

Thank you for chatting with me today to discuss the mobile develop position with Yahoo. I truly enjoyed the talking and appealed by the fantastic internship in Yahoo!.

I would like to stress my interest in this position. Your description of how one can work with other facuties as a team was especially appealing to me. My abilities to work with a team have been enhanced by my experience working on projects in my agile software product mangement course. This experience has shown me how important it is to work with a team with a efficient management mathod. My interest mainly lies in native Android development and web back end. 

Once again thank you for the opportunity to interview for the position. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 224-410-9446 or at jinsun2014@u.northwestern.edu. 
 
I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
 
Sincerely, 

Jin Sun
